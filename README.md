# Wikipedia-Text-Mining-Clustering

Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to mine data from the [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/) website and perform classification.


Resources:
This project was performed with the guidance of the following websites:

 * [Manipulate clusters of texts with R](https://dzone.com/articles/manipulate-clusters-of-texts)
 * [R : Categorization / Clustering Of Wikipedia Articles Using R](http://brazenly.blogspot.gr/2015/02/r-categorization-clustering-of.html)
 * [Text mining in R â€“ Automatic categorization of Wikipedia articles](https://www.r-bloggers.com/text-mining-in-r-automatic-categorization-of-wikipedia-articles/)

Data:
To perform this analysis I chose 9 articles of 3 different topics. The articles are:
- From Geography: Alaska, California, Florida
- From Mathematics: Square, Rectangular, Rhombus
- From NBA: Bulls, Bucks, Spurs

Analysis:
The analysis is available as a Markdown document [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Kokkalo4/Wikipedia-Classification-Project/blob/master/Wikipedia%20Text%20Classification.html) and involves the following:

- Reading the data
- Transforming the data
- Visualizing the data
